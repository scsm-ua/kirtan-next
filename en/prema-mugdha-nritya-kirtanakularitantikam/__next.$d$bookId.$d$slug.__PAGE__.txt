1b:T4c7,It was in the sacred place of Prayāga, in the bathing area known as Daśāśvamedha Ghāṭa, that Lord Gaurāṅga taught Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī that the ultimate objective of one’s devotional practices is to relish the sweet mellows found in Śrī Vṛndāvan, and the Lord instructed him to widely distribute that sweetness. Later in Kāśī, the Lord elaborately described to Śrīla Sanātan Goswāmī many topics of pure dedication, such as knowledge of proper acquaintance with the environment, the means of applying that knowledge, and the ultimate goal of obtaining pure love of Godhead. Also, at the special request of a Maharastrian *brāhmaṇ* and Tapana Miśra and other devotees, the Lord destroyed the ignorant conception of the *māyāvādī* renunciates in Vārāṇasī. Lord Gaurāṅgadev personally met the impersonalists there in a public assembly, and pointed out that their mode of self-adoration was ultimately based on enviousness and narrow-mindedness. In this way the Lord established that factual independence was exhibited by those worshipping the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*.1c:T64f,“Superior to the spiritual realm of Vaikuṇṭha is Mathurā, where Śrī Krishna first appears. Superior to Mathurā is the Vṛndāvan forest where Krishna enjoyed the *rāsa* dance. Better still is Govardhan Hill, which was the site of even more confidential Pastimes of love. But best of all is Rādhā Kuṇḍa, which is situated at the foot of Govardhan Hill, and holds the supreme position because it is over-flooded with the nectar of the highest kind of divine love. Who, acquainted with the science of devotion, will not aspire for the divine service of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī at Rādhā Kuṇḍa?” Initially, Lord Gaurāṅga revealed the nature of pure loving service rendered unto the son of Nanda Mahārāj in the parental relationship. But when considering the flow of dedication’s sweet mellows, Lord Gaurāṅga described the ultimate aspect of the Supreme Lord’s personality to be Śrī Gopījanavallabha, whose divine figure is the unlimited reservoir of all the primary and secondary mellows tasted in pure devotion. Śrī Gaurāṅga also hinted that the joyful and charming *rāsa-līlā* Pastimes are an allconscious reality, none other than the personal potency of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Such transcendental Pastimes are found within the superexcellent and inconceivable spiritual world, and are the highest conception of spiritual existence, auspiciousness, and beauty.
