1b:T4ce,The grand intellectual Sārvabhauma tried his level best t oestablish the impersonal doctrine of Śaṅkarāchārya, which is in direct opposition to the conclusions of pure dedication. Sārvabhauma used the most deceitful means in the art of word jugglery. He tried to pervert the sense of words, he idly heckled the arguments or assertions of the Lord without attempting to prove the opposite side, and he tried to find the weak points in the Lord’s arguments. However, Śrī Chaitanya, whose charming figure was cloaked in the fresh garments of a radiant renunciate, presented consistent arguments in conjunction with the Vedic literatures, and easily checked and destroyed the scholar’s atheistic interpretations. The Lord loudly proclaimed that the doctrine of Śaṅkarāchārya is practiced by followers in the ascending method of understanding who are interested in their external selfadoration. Such worship is the product of a demoniac intellect and backed by atheistic perseverance. All importance given to the nonmanifest aspect of material nature was refuted when Lord Gaurasundar established that spiritual variegatedness in the Supreme Lord’s personality is the highest reality taught in the Vedic literature.d:["$","$L1a",null,{"label":"Show verses / translation","song":{"meta":{"page":100,"first_line":"dhvasta-sārvvabhauma-vāda-navya-tarka-śāṅkaraṁ","author":"Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj"},"title":["Śrī Śrī","Premadhāma-deva-stotram"],"author":["Composed by Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj","Edited by Swāmī Bhakti Pāvan Janārdan"],"subtitle":["Monday"],"verses":[{"number":"21","text":["dhvasta-sārvabhauma-vāda-navya-tarka-śāṅkaraṁ","dhvasta-tad-vivarta-vāda-dānavīya-ḍambaram","darśitārtha-sarva-śāstra-kṛṣṇa-bhakti-mandiraṁ","prema-dhāma-devam eva naumi gaura-sundaram"],"translation":["$1b","This was shown in the Lord’s explanation of the Upaniṣads, where it is stated:","*apāṇipādo javano grahitā*\\","*paśyatyachakṣuḥ sa śṛṇotyakarṇaḥ*","“The Lord has no hands or legs, yet He walks and touches.
