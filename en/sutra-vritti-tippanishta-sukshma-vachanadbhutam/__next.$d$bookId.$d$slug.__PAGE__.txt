1b:T461,Arriving in the sacred place of pilgrimage, Śrī Nīlāchala, the valiant king of the renounced order, Śrī Chaitanyadeva, saved the most powerful scholar recognized throughout the length and breadth of India. Śrī Vāsudeva Sārvabhauma, the most dynamic intellectual of all time in the vast Vedantic doctrine and school of logistics, was rescued by the Lord from the impersonal well of Śaṅkarāchārya’s theory. Later, the Lord travelled to southern India, where He encountered the followers of various philisophical doctrines. Wherever He travelled, the aspirations of the devotees met their highest fulfillment, as the Lord was like a desire tree. On the banks of the Godāvarī River, the Lord met that deep raincloud of pure dedication Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya, and instructed him to shower upon others the sweet raindrops of rasa which exist in the land of spontaneous devotion, Vraja. Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya also answered the questions the merciful Lord posed with the essence of all instruction.
