# Song Navigation (Prev/Next) Architecture

The prev/next song flow has **three independent input sources** that all converge on the same animated indicator circle and ultimately `window.location.href`.

## Inputs → Output

| Input | Source | Triggers |
|---|---|---|
| Touch swipe | `components/song/PrevNextNav/SwipeNav.tsx` (touch listeners on `document.body`) | Immediate navigation when progress fills the ring |
| Keyboard hotkey | `other/hooks/useGlobalHotkeys.ts` dispatches `kirtan:prevSong` / `kirtan:nextSong` window events | `SwipeNav` listens, plays a synthetic slide-in animation, then navigates |
| Visible buttons | `components/song/PrevNextNav/PrevNextLink.tsx` (plain `<a href>`) | Native browser navigation |

`PrevNextNav.tsx` is the container — it computes `prevNext` from `navMap` + `usePageQuery()` and passes it to both `PrevNextLink` and `SwipeNav`. **It does not listen for hotkey events** — that belongs in `SwipeNav` because the animation is owned there.

## Hotkey Bindings (in `useGlobalHotkeys.ts`)

| Keys | Event dispatched |
|---|---|
| `,` `[` `-` `ArrowLeft` | `kirtan:prevSong` |
| `.` `]` `=` `ArrowRight` | `kirtan:nextSong` |

`ArrowLeft` / `ArrowRight` must call `e.preventDefault()` to suppress the browser's horizontal scroll.

## Direction Semantics (easy to get wrong)

Inside `SwipeNav`:

- `direction === 'left'`  → user is dragging finger leftward → reveals the **next** song (circle enters from the **right** edge)
- `direction === 'right'` → user is dragging finger rightward → reveals the **previous** song (circle enters from the **left** edge)
- `onLeftEdge = (direction === 'right')` — the variable names refer to which screen edge the circle sits on, not the direction of travel.

Use the helpers — do not re-derive:

- `pickTarget(prevNext, direction)` → returns the correct `prev` or `next` `TNavItem`
- `restingLeft(onLeftEdge)` → the X position the circle settles at when fully revealed
- `arrowCls(flip)` → arrow icon className (chevron points right by default, flipped on the left edge)
- `flyOut(el, direction)` → drives the exit transition

## Animation Timing (hotkey flow)

All timings are named constants at the top of `SwipeNav.tsx`. If you change one of these, prefer adjusting the constant over inlining a different number:

| Constant | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ENTER_DURATION_MS` (220) | Slide-in duration. **Must match** the `left` value in the entry transition string |
| `HOLD_MS` (60) | Brief pause at peak so the user perceives the filled circle |
| `EXIT_DURATION_MS` (400) | Fly-off duration. Mostly cosmetic — see below |

**Navigation fires together with `flyOut`**, not after it. The exit animation is cosmetic cover while the next page loads; if the page loads fast the animation gets cut short, which is the desired tradeoff (no perceived latency penalty). Do not wrap navigation in `setTimeout(..., EXIT_DURATION_MS)` "to let the animation finish" — that adds 400ms to every navigation.

## The Two Circles

`SwipeNav` renders **two** indicator `<div>`s:

1. **Swipe circle** — conditionally rendered (`{direction && swipeTarget && ...}`), driven by React state (`progress`, `direction`), used during finger drag
2. **Keyboard circle** — always mounted, hidden by `opacity: 0`, driven imperatively via `keyCircleRef` / `keyArrowRef`. Always mounted so `requestAnimationFrame` has a painted element to animate from

Both share `SHARED_STYLE` (CSS custom properties) and the `<NavRing>` SVG component.

## Hooks-Rules Gotcha

`PrevNextNav.tsx` has an early `return null` when `pageQuery` is not a string. Any new `useEffect`/`useState` calls must be placed **above** that return, or React will throw "change in the order of Hooks called."

## Static Export Compatibility

`next.config.ts` uses `output: 'export'` (fully static). All navigation code is `'use client'` and uses browser APIs (`window`, `localStorage`, `CustomEvent`, `requestAnimationFrame`) — never add server-side logic to this subsystem.
